## google-spreadsheet adapter for ioBroker

This adapter can be used to automatically interact with google spreadsheets.

## Features

* [Append data to spreadsheet](features/append.md)
* [Delete rows from a spreadsheet](features/delete-rows.md)
* [Create sheets](features/create-sheet.md)
* [Delete sheets](features/delete-sheet.md)
* [Duplicate sheets](features/duplicate-sheet.md)
* [Read cell](features/read-cell.md)
* [Write cell](features/write-cell.md)

## Usage

### Setup

#### Enable API Access
1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=sheets.googleapis.com).

2. Create or select an existing project that you wish to use with the API.

3. Enable the Google Spreadsheet API for your project.

#### Create a Service Account

For the project you selected in the previous step, create a new service account in Google Cloud IAM by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the IAM & Admin page in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam).

2. Click on "Service accounts" and then "Create Service Account."

3. Provide a name for the service account and select the role "Project" > "Editor."

4. Click "Continue" to proceed to the next step.

5. On the "Keys" tab, click "Create Key" and choose the format as "JSON." Then click "Continue."

6. Your private key will be generated and automatically downloaded. Keep this file secure as you will need it later.

#### Grant Access to the Spreadsheet

Open the spreadsheet you want to interact with and share it with the email address of your newly created service account:

1. Open the desired spreadsheet in Google Sheets.

2. Click "Share" in the upper right corner.

3. Enter the email address of the service account in the "Add people" field and grant it the necessary permissions (e.g., "Edit" or "View").

4. Click "Send" to complete the sharing process.

#### Configure the Adapter Instance

Add the following information to the configuration of your adapter instance in ioBroker:

- **Spreadsheet ID** - You can find the ID in the URL of your spreadsheet.
- **Service Account** - The email address of the service account you created.
- **Private Key** - Open the downloaded JSON file, and locate the private key within the file. Copy only the part starting with "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----."


#### Find the Spreadsheet ID in the URL

To locate the "Spreadsheet ID" in the URL of your Google Sheets document, follow these steps:

1. When you open your Google Sheets document in a web browser, the URL in the address bar will look something like this:

```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit
```
2. The "SPREADSHEET_ID" is the long string of characters and numbers between the "/d/" and "/edit" parts of the URL.


### Blockly

Use the available blocks to automatically interact with your spreadsheet.

## Troubleshooting

### Error while sending data to Google Spreadsheet:Error: error:0909006C:PEM routines:get_name:no start line
When copying the private key into the configuration, make sure there are no \n. If there are \n in the key, please replace the with normal line breaks

### Error while sending data to Google Spreadsheet:Error: The caller does not have permission
Make sure the Service Account has adequate permissions to write to the spreadsheet. Refer to the "Grant Access to the Spreadsheet" section above.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
